                The Cyber Violence Against Women and Girls (CyVAWG) project was
                a three-month initiative (January – March 2025) led by Dr.
                Anitha Chinnaswamy, Programme Director for MSc Cyber Security
                Management and Deputy Director of the Cyber Security Innovation
                Research Centre at Aston University. Funded by Innovate UK and
                supported by the Department for Science, Innovation and
                Technology (DSIT) and West Midlands Police, the project explored
                the urgent and evolving issue of technology-facilitated abuse,
                specifically its impact on women and girls in the UK. As the
                digital world becomes more integrated into our daily lives, new
                forms of abuse, such as stalking via smart devices,
                non-consensual image sharing, online harassment, deepfake
                exploitation, and abuse in immersive environments like the
                metaverse, are increasingly prevalent. CyVAWG aimed to create
                awareness, equip communities, and inspire action.
