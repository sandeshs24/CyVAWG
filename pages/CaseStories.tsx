//     description: "Samantha Billingham details her transformative journey from enduring covert, technology-facilitated abuse to emerging as a resilient advocate for survivors. Her experience highlights the subtle, yet pervasive nature of coercive control, where digital tools are misused to isolate and manipulate, resulting in significant psychological and emotional impacts. Through her personal narrative, Samantha underscores the critical need for early recognition of abuse and the importance of supportive interventions. Her development of the ABC Toolkit stands as a practical resource, empowering others to identify red flags and seek help. This case study is a compelling call to action for improved legal protections, comprehensive digital safety education, and robust support systems for those affected by cyber-enabled domestic abuse.",

Despite the immersive trauma—triggering panic attacks and professional repercussions—Meta dismissed the incident as non-consensual imagery, not rape, and took no action. Patel faced victim-blaming and found no legal recourse, as virtual assault lacks evidentiary frameworks and legal recognition. Her case exposes systemic failures: VR platforms lack moderation, reporting tools, and accountability, while laws lag behind tech-enabled abuse. Patel now advocates for VR safety reforms, underscoring the urgent need for platform accountability, trauma-informed policies, and legal updates to address virtual violence as a real-world harm.",
